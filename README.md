This repository contains Matlab code and required files to calculate robustness metrics for RoR hydropower design. 
The methodology presented in the paper by  V. Yildiz, S.F. Brown, C. Rougé  "Revisiting small hydropower design in a drought-prone world" submitted to the Water Resources Research.


# Robustness Analysis Files and HYPER Simulations

This folder contains MATLAB code for performing robustness analysis on five case studies, along with a separate file for post-processing the robustness results. Additionally, pre-calculated robustness results are provided.

## Case Studies

The robustness analysis files are provided for the following five case studies:

1. Case Study 1: [Besik RoR]
2. Case Study 2: [Tepe RoR]
3. Case Study 3: [Karacay RoR]
4. Case Study 4: [Kaplan RoR]
5. Case Study 5: [Buyukdere RoR]

For each case study, there are MATLAB files that can be used to calculate the design robustness under various scenarios. However, to save time, pre-calculated robustness results are also provided for reference.

## Robustness Calculation

To calculate the design robustness for each case study, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have MATLAB installed on your system.
2. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
3. Open MATLAB and navigate to the folder containing the MATLAB code for the desired case study.
4. Run the MATLAB script or function specific to the case study and scenario you want to analyze.

## Robustness Results

Pre-calculated robustness results are provided for each case study, allowing you to review and compare the robustness of different designs without running the analysis from scratch. The results can be found in the respective case study folders.

## Robustness Metrics Quantification

To  analyze the robustness results, a robustness metrics quantification file, `Robustness_Metrics.m`,  is provided. This file contains MATLAB code that can be used to calculate various robustness metrics based on the obtained results. You can use this file to quantify and compare the robustness of different designs across the case studies.

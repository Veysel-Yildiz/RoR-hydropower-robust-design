This repository contains Matlab code and required files to calculate robustness metrics for RoR hydropower design. 
The methodology presented in the paper by  V. Yildiz, S.F. Brown, C. Rougé  "Revisiting small hydropower design in a drought-prone world" submitted to the Water Resources Research.

The library is built exclusively using Matlab code; It consists of a single matlab code to calculate robustness metrics and data files for each case studies 

Contents:

`Robustness_Metrics.m`: This is the main file to run to calculate robustness metrics. It seperately runs for each case study. Spar table contains all the robustness metrics.
